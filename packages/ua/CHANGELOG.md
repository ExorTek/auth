# @exortek/ua

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- b9e0647: Publish only the package-root README, CHANGELOG and LICENSE.

  The `files` list matched those names at any depth rather than just the root, so a nested document was published
  alongside them — `@exortek/oauth2` shipped its `examples/README.md`. The entries are now anchored to the package root.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- e53ae64: Fix polynomial-ReDoS (quadratic regex backtracking) surfaced by CodeQL, plus small code-quality fixes.
  Bundled `@exortek/shared` utilities (base32, base64, duration) are inlined into the packages listed above, so each
  ships the fix.

  - Replace `/=+$/` trailing-padding strips (base32 / base64 decode, OTP provisioning URI) with linear scans —
    `"=".repeat(n) + "x"` was O(n²).
  - Rework the duration parser regex so surrounding whitespace can no longer cause O(n²) matching (trim first, single
    interior `\s*`).
  - Strip trailing spaces/dots in filename sanitisation with a linear scan — upload filenames are attacker-controlled.
  - Cap email length before the regex in magic-link.
  - Thread the JWT decode label into error messages (removes dead arguments and gives failures which segment broke).
  - Drop a duplicate character in a UA browser-detection regex character class.

  DoS-hardening and hygiene only — no API or behavioural change for valid input.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 16ce437: Initial release of `@exortek/ua` — high-performance User-Agent parser with browser, OS, device, engine, CPU
  detection, bot/AI crawler taxonomy, Client Hints support, request fingerprinting, and Express/Fastify middleware.
